Dear, NSDL Team,
I am writing you to concern the problem about the refund of PAN card update fees.
I was updating my pan card details online through NSDL website and tried the same procedure 3 time on the website, but it didn't update and was getting the same message of doing it through any PAN card updating centres, so I had to pay fees 3 times of Rs.106.90. I have received a refund of one time fess, but I haven't got refund of remaining 2 times fees of Rs. 106.90.
So, I request you to refund fees of remaining 2 times.
Thank you,
Kind Regards,
